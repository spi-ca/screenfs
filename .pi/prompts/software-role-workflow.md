description: Run software work through user representative, systems engineer, designer, parallel-capable developer, implementer, QA, and reviewer subagents
argument-hint: "<task>"
---
Run this software-writing task through the project-local role agents:

Task:
$ARGUMENTS

Use the `subagent` tool with a chain when available. Use `mode: "spawn"` unless the current conversation context is required.

Role set:
1. `user-representative` — preserve user intent, acceptance criteria, user-facing scenarios, and blockers.
2. `software-systems-engineer` — inspect OS/runtime/dependency/permission/deployment/operational constraints and system-level verification.
3. `software-designer` — produce implementation design, change scope, risks, work packages, and verification strategy.
4. `software-developer` — conditionally implement one independent work package with focused validation; multiple lanes may run in parallel when file scopes do not overlap.
5. `software-implementer` — apply or integrate approved changes and run focused validation.
6. `software-qa` — validate acceptance criteria with tests/checks/smoke evidence.
7. `software-reviewer` — review diff, quality, regressions, and completion evidence.

Required for every task: user representative, systems engineer when system constraints matter, designer, implementer, QA, and reviewer. Use `software-developer` only when the design identifies at least one independent work package; otherwise document why it was skipped and implement sequentially.

Recommended serial discovery/design chain shape:

```json
{
  "chain": [
    {
      "agent": "user-representative",
      "task": "Summarize user intent, acceptance criteria, user-facing scenarios, constraints, and blockers for: $ARGUMENTS"
    },
    {
      "agent": "software-systems-engineer",
      "task": "Using prior outputs, inspect repository/environment constraints and provide system-level feasibility, risks, and verification for: $ARGUMENTS"
    },
    {
      "agent": "software-designer",
      "task": "Using prior outputs, design the implementation plan and verification strategy for: $ARGUMENTS"
    }
  ],
  "mode": "spawn"
}
```

Use parallel development only when the designer has separated non-overlapping work packages:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "agent": "software-developer",
      "task": "Implement independent work package A for: $ARGUMENTS. Allowed files: <paths>. Acceptance criteria: <criteria>. Preserve existing behavior outside this package. Run focused validation: <commands>."
    },
    {
      "agent": "software-developer",
      "task": "Implement independent work package B for: $ARGUMENTS. Allowed files: <paths>. Acceptance criteria: <criteria>. Preserve existing behavior outside this package. Run focused validation: <commands>."
    }
  ],
  "mode": "spawn"
}
```

Keep implementation merge serial, then run QA/review in parallel when read-only scopes do not overlap:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "agent": "software-qa",
      "task": "Validate the implementation against acceptance criteria for: $ARGUMENTS"
    },
    {
      "agent": "software-reviewer",
      "task": "Review the implementation, evidence, maintainability, and completion readiness for: $ARGUMENTS"
    }
  ],
  "mode": "spawn"
}
```

If there is exactly one independent package, run one `software-developer` lane before `software-implementer` integration. If the work cannot be safely split into a developer package, skip `software-developer` and use `software-implementer` sequentially.

If project-local subagent confirmation is required, do not try to bypass it. Ask for confirmation or fall back to role-by-role execution in the root agent.

Do not finish until every explicit requirement is mapped to current evidence from files, commands, diffs, tests, logs, or artifacts. Mount lifecycle/shutdown changes specifically require evidence for `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` handling, cancellation handoff, graceful FUSE serve-loop exit, explicit `fusermount3 -u <mountpoint>` cleanup, and any operator-visible lazy-unmount fallback/manual command guidance. If validation fails, triage and fix the cause before final reporting.
